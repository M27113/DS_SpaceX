# DS_SpaceX_Falcon_9_first_stage_Landing_Prediction
## Introduction
A Data Science project focused on analyzing SpaceX launch data to gain insights into launch outcomes, predict success rates, and visualize key trends. This project leverages Python, data wrangling, machine learning, and interactive visualizations.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
1. Collect and preprocess SpaceX launch data (via APIs, CSV, or web scraping).
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in launch outcomes.
3. Build and evaluate Machine Learning models to predict launch success.
4. Visualize findings through plots, dashboards, and interactive tools.
### Problem 
The key problem is predicting the landing success of the Falcon 9 first stage based on specific flight features.
(The launch success rate may dependon many factors such as payload mass, orbit type, and so on. It may alsodepend on the location and proximities of a launch site, i.e., the initialposition of rocket trajectories. Finding an optimal location for building alaunch site certainly involves many factors and hopefully we could discoversome of the factors by analyzing the existing launch site locations. Findingbest fit ML model is also important.)
